    "## Some clarifications about the PBH test for reachability, controllability and stabilizabilty\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have discussed in class, the key concept when it comes to state-transfer for a discrete-time linear system\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    x_{t+1}=Ax_t+Bu_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "is **reachability**, i.e. the ability to steer the system state from $x_0=0$ to any $x_{\\rm tgt}$ at some future time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic analysis, that you have also done in the basic course (although for a continuous-time system), is that a system is reachable if and only if the observability matrix \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{C}_n = \\begin{pmatrix} A^{n-1}B & A^{n-2}B & \\cdots & AB & B\\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "has full rank. A nice by-product of the proof of this statement is that we know what whenever the system is reachable, you reach every target state in exact $n$ steps (where $n$ is the system order). Of course, this statement is only valid if you do not have any constraints on $x_t$ and $u_t$, and the control may be far from optimal in other aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you only have a single input, then the controllability matrix is square and you can check that it has full rank by computing its determinant. However, when the system has more inputs, checking for full rank becomes more complicated (at least by hand). Moreover, if the system is not reachable, the controllability matrix gives you no direct insight into whether the system is controllable or stabilizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PBH test is much more helpful in this respect. We will also see that it is a very useful theoretical tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PBH test states that a linear system is **unreachable** if and only if there is a vector $w\\neq 0$ and a scalar $\\lambda$ such that\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    w^{\\top}A = \\lambda w^{\\top}, \\qquad w^{\\top}B=0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Hence if the system is reachable, there can be no solution $(w, \\lambda)$ to these equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The naming of variables in the PBH test is no coincidence: $\\lambda$ is indeed an eigenvalue of $A$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, to verify the PBH test by pen-and-paper, you first compute the eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ of $A$. For each of these, you compute the corresponding vector $w_i$ from $w_i^{\\top}A=\\lambda w_i^{\\top}$ and test if it also satisfies $w_i^{\\top}B=0$. If you can find any such combination $(\\lambda_i, w_i)$, the system is unreachable.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned on the lectures, $w$ defines directions in the state space in which we cannot control the state vector. In particular, $z_t = w^{\\top}x_t$ satisfies\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    z_{t+1} = w^{\\top}x_{t+1}=w^{\\top}(Ax_t + Bu_t) = w^{\\top}Ax_t = \\lambda w^{\\top}x_t = \\lambda z_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Therefore, if we find $(\\lambda_i, w_i)$ that satisfy the equations of the PBH test, it is fine if $\\vert \\lambda_i\\vert<1$, since the dynamics that we cannot control will be asymptotically stable. If every $\\lambda$ that satisfies the PBH equations has magnitude less than one, we call the system stabilizable. If all $\\lambda_i$ that satisfy the PBH equations are equal to zero, the system is controllable. If any $\\lambda_i$ that satisfies the PBH equation has magnitude greater than one, then we are in trouble. The system is unreachable, and the part of the state vector that we cannot control grows exponentially (\"is unstable\").\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note.** How can we claim that $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$? Assuming that you are familiar with the standard right eigenvectors\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    Av = \\lambda v\n",
    "$$\n",
    "we can tranpose the first PBH equation\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    (w^{\\top}A)^{\\top}=(\\lambda w^{\\top})^{\\top} \\Rightarrow A^{\\top} w = \\lambda w\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Hence, $w$ is a \"standard\" right eigenvector of $A^{\\top}$. But a classic result from linear algebra (see the appendix of the lecture notes) states that $A$ and $A^{\\top}$ have the same eigenvalues. Hence, $\\lambda$ in the PBH equations is indeed an eigenvalue of $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This discussion also shows how we can perform the PBH test numerically: we compute the eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ and eigenvectors $w_i$ of $A^{\\top}$, and then check if any of these eigenvectors satisfy $w_i^{\\top}B=0$. If they do, then the magnitude of the corresponding $\\lambda_i$'s determine if the system is controllable, stabilizable, or unreachable. Let us try this technique on the systems in Exercise 1.5 (please also try to solve them by the paper-and-pen method described above!)"
